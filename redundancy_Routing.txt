To design a system with redundancy for failover scenarios, you can implement various strategies depending on your requirements and available resources. Here's a suggested approach based on your current setup:

1. **High Availability Router**: Ensure that your router is capable of high availability features such as High Availability (HA) or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). This allows for automatic failover between two routers if one fails.

2. **Switch Redundancy**: Use redundant switches to connect to the router. Implement Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) or Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) to provide loop-free topology and handle switch failovers.

3. **Redundant Connections**: Connect each switch to both router interfaces. This provides redundancy at the switch level, so if one switch fails, traffic can still flow through the other switch.

4. **Default Gateway Configuration**: Instead of having one switch connection handle default gateway for specific VLANs, configure both switches to handle all VLANs' default gateways. This ensures that if one switch fails, traffic can still be routed through the other switch.

5. **VLAN Configuration**: Ensure that VLANs are configured consistently across both switches. This includes VLAN membership, VLAN trunking, and VLAN interface configurations.

6. **Load Balancing**: Consider implementing load balancing mechanisms to distribute traffic evenly across both router interfaces and switches. This can help optimize network performance and utilization.

7. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to detect failures and notify administrators promptly. This allows for proactive management and quick response to any issues that may arise.

8. **Testing and Maintenance**: Regularly test failover scenarios and conduct maintenance activities to ensure that redundancy mechanisms are functioning correctly. This helps identify and address any potential issues before they impact production environments.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a robust and resilient network design with redundancy for failover scenarios. It's essential to carefully plan and configure each component to ensure seamless operation and minimize downtime in case of failures.

To automate the replication of files from an FTP server to other servers for high availability, you can use scripting or automation tools to periodically synchronize the files. Here's a general approach using scripting:

1. **Choose a scripting language**: You can use scripting languages like Bash, Python, or PowerShell, depending on your preference and the operating system of your servers.

2. **Write a script for file synchronization**:
    - Connect to the FTP server: Use FTP client commands within your script to connect to the FTP server.
    - List files: Retrieve a list of files from the FTP server.
    - Connect to other servers: Use SSH (for Linux servers) or WinRM (for Windows servers) to connect to the destination servers.
    - Compare files: Compare the list of files obtained from the FTP server with the files already present on the destination servers to determine which files need to be replicated.
    - Copy or synchronize files: Use commands like `scp` (for Linux) or `Copy-Item` (for Windows) to copy or synchronize files from the FTP server to the destination servers.

3. **Schedule the script**: Use cron jobs (on Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows) to schedule the script to run periodically, ensuring that files are replicated at regular intervals.

4. **Handle errors and logging**: Implement error handling in your script to deal with connection failures or file transfer errors. Also, add logging functionality to track the status of file replication tasks.

5. **Test thoroughly**: Before deploying the automation script in a production environment, thoroughly test it in a controlled environment to ensure that it functions as expected and replicates files accurately.

Alternatively, you can use specialized tools for file synchronization and replication, such as rsync for Linux or Robocopy for Windows. These tools offer more advanced features and may be more suitable for complex replication scenarios. Additionally, some FTP servers may have built-in features or plugins for file replication that you can leverage.
