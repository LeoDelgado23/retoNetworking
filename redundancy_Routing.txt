To design a system with redundancy for failover scenarios, you can implement various strategies depending on your requirements and available resources. Here's a suggested approach based on your current setup:

1. **High Availability Router**: Ensure that your router is capable of high availability features such as High Availability (HA) or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). This allows for automatic failover between two routers if one fails.

2. **Switch Redundancy**: Use redundant switches to connect to the router. Implement Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) or Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) to provide loop-free topology and handle switch failovers.

3. **Redundant Connections**: Connect each switch to both router interfaces. This provides redundancy at the switch level, so if one switch fails, traffic can still flow through the other switch.

4. **Default Gateway Configuration**: Instead of having one switch connection handle default gateway for specific VLANs, configure both switches to handle all VLANs' default gateways. This ensures that if one switch fails, traffic can still be routed through the other switch.

5. **VLAN Configuration**: Ensure that VLANs are configured consistently across both switches. This includes VLAN membership, VLAN trunking, and VLAN interface configurations.

6. **Load Balancing**: Consider implementing load balancing mechanisms to distribute traffic evenly across both router interfaces and switches. This can help optimize network performance and utilization.

7. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to detect failures and notify administrators promptly. This allows for proactive management and quick response to any issues that may arise.

8. **Testing and Maintenance**: Regularly test failover scenarios and conduct maintenance activities to ensure that redundancy mechanisms are functioning correctly. This helps identify and address any potential issues before they impact production environments.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a robust and resilient network design with redundancy for failover scenarios. It's essential to carefully plan and configure each component to ensure seamless operation and minimize downtime in case of failures.
